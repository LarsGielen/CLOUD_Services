# Introduction

This project is a REST API developed using Flask, a web framework for Python. The API serves as a backend for managing locations, organizers, events and bookings. The application uses SQLAlchemy for database operations and follows REST principles for designing endpoints.

# Running the API server

Before running the API, make sure to install the required dependencies. The following command installs the necessary packages:

```console
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Faker
```

To start the server, open a Python console and run the following command:

```console
from server import *
```

# Using the API

The API consists of 4 main endpoints: \
[/api/locations](#locations) \
[/api/organizers](#organizers) \
[/api/events](#events) \
[/api/booking](#booking)
